PMN-Subaqueous-Detection-GUI is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application for underwater multi-object detection, designed to analyze images, videos, and real-time camera feeds for marine entities such as polymetallic nodules (PMN) mainly and fish, coral, algae, reefs etc. It integrates advanced computer vision models, including YOLO, Haar Cascade, and Faster R-CNN, with a Tkinter-based interface. 
I would like to thank my Guide Mr.Prabhakaran for helping to solve all my queries and problem statements. This Application is built to deploy in realtime applications. This app was mainly designed for Polymetallic Nodules but we extended to more living organisms. 

# Advantages
1) Supports multiple object detection models: YOLO, Haar Cascade, and Faster R-CNN.
2) Real-time detection using single/multiple cameras or IP/static sources.
3) Intuitive GUI built with Tkinter (PAGE generated).
4) Image and video input support and live stream or camera functionality added on.
5) Visualization pane with frame area and seabed distance estimation.
6) Dataset support for five categories: Fish, PMN, Coral, Alagae, Reef.
7) Provides numerical and statitical results for flora, fauna, algae, and nodules.
8) No Internet Required to run.

# Disadvantages
1) IP camera validation is basic (only checks if opened).
2) Requires more testing
3) GUI is large and may not fit smaller screens.

# Input Types
1)  Images: JPG, PNG, BMP
2)  Videos: MP4, AVI, MOV
3)  Live Cameras: Static or IP-based (4 camera support)

# Additional Points:
1) Install all dependencies and libraries
2) Add the trained models Files to the dataset option.
3) It would be slow sometimes in an ineffiecient computer lacking GPU needs and Less RAM.
4) It would be able to show each detection in its class separately in visualization.

# Future scope:
1) Adding more functionality.
2) Aiming for high accuracy.
3) Extending to more number of realtime applications and problems.
4) Add more ip cameras and bring live feed without any drawbacks or issues.
5) More flexible and could be integrated any device such as smartphones, watches etc.
